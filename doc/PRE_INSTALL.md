This package compiles Vaultwarden from sources, that can take a long time on a small computer :

* When installing on a Raspberry Pi 3, this can take more than 1 hour.
* When installing from the webadmin, you can encounter the "504 Gateway Timeout": this is fine, just let it finish in the background.
